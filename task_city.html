        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Moscow, on the Moskva River in western Russia, is the nation’s cosmopolitan capital. In its historic core is the Kremlin, a complex that’s home to the president and tsarist treasures in the Armoury. Outside its walls is Red Square, Russia's symbolic center. It's home to Lenin’s Mausoleum, the State Historical Museum's comprehensive collection and St. Basil’s Cathedral, known for its colorful, onion-shaped domes.
        </b></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Moscow, the capital of Russia, is located in the far western part of the country on the Moscow River. The city has played a vital role in Russian history since it was first mentioned in chronicles in 1147. Moscow became the capital of Muscovy in the late 13th century. Today, it is the country's most populous city and its industrial, cultural, scientific, and educational center. Moscow has also been the spiritual center of the Russian Orthodox Church for more than 600 years. The city's layout features concentric rings and radiating spokes, reflecting its historical growth.

        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Shanghai, on China’s central coast, is the country's biggest city and a global financial hub. Its heart is the Bund, a famed waterfront promenade lined with colonial-era buildings. Across the Huangpu River rises the Pudong district’s futuristic skyline, including 632m Shanghai Tower and the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, with distinctive pink spheres. Sprawling Yu Garden has traditional pavilions, towers and ponds

        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Shanghai, where one in five of its population is made up of temporary in-migrants from predominantly rural China, is the key city setting the pattern for the explosive urban growth in Asia. It is as much a phenomenon of our times as the equally rapid and – to its contemporaries – equally disturbing transformation of Western industrial cities of the early 19th century. It is a phenomenon which is producing a sense of strangeness and dislocation, this time bound up with the overwhelming impact of speed. When the British happened on the Chinese walled settlement of Shanghai towards the end of the Opium War and fought for their right to sell the opium that they cultivated in India to the citizens of the Chinese empire, there was nothing on what is now the Pudong side of the Huang Po River. British traders, attracted by the river traffic on the Yangtze river and its many tributaries linking inland China and the trade routes from Europe, America and later Japan, persuaded their government to insist on their unhindered access to Shanghai’s port.</b></p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Berlin, Germany’s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the city's turbulent 20th-century history include its Holocaust memorial and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the Cold War, its 18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification. The city's also known for its art scene and modern landmarks like the gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie, built in 1963.
        </b></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Since the early 1990s,Berlin has, above all, been a huge building site, and architecture often had to grapple with paradoxical expectations: on the one hand, the ‘Planwerk Innenstadt’, a decidedly anti-modern reurbanisation and city-centre revitalisation directive, decreed that the ‘historical city’ should be recovered; on the other hand, politicians and residents alike expected the architectural fraternity to create a metropolis of the future.As a result, a lot of sound yet middling designs, but few masterpieces,were realised. Bold and innovative architectural statements are indeed very few and far between in this city.Today’s general sense of
disappointment with this state of affairs has less to do with the buildings themselves than with the hopes and expectations of the 1990s. People had once more been prepared to put their faith in the redemptive power of good architecture, only to discover yet again that redemption is the one thing architecture cannot offer.Most importantly, however, the new government buildings or the redeveloped Potsdamer Platz failed to project an image that Berliners could recognise. The city remained as fragmented as ever.</b></p>
